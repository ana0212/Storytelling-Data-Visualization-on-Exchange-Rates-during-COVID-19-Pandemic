# Storytelling-Data-Visualization-on-Exchange-Rates-during-COVID-19-Pandemic

- In this project, we analyzed the exchange rate between the euro and other strong currencies: US Dollar/USD, British Pound/GBP, Swiss Franc/CHF and Australian Dollar/AUD.
- In addition, we were focused on the period of the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2022) to discuss how these rates behaved during this time.
- Our goal was to visualize the impact of the pandemic, and possible devaluations and recoveries.
-In the Exploratory Data Analysis section, we analysed the Exchange rate in the whole period of time and in the COVID-19 period (2020-2022). We found that the range of the Exchange rate in this period was short (arround 0.1 for the US Dollar, UK Pound and Swiss Franc and arround 0.3 for the AUS Dollar). Comparing with other historical facts, like the financial crisis in 2008, the Euro was able to mantain a stability.
